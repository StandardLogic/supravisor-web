# Protecting Your Agent

You don't need to be a developer to use this. No code. No command line. Just a web browser and 15 minutes.

Here's the situation: your AI agent — whether it's Claude, ChatGPT, or something else — has real capabilities. It can browse websites, send emails, read your files, and sometimes spend money on your behalf. Right now, there's probably nothing stopping it from doing too much, going somewhere it shouldn't, or making a decision you'd want to review first.

Supravisor fixes that. It gives your agent an official ID, defines exactly what it's allowed to do, and keeps a permanent record of every action it took.

## The Simple Version

Imagine you hired a contractor to work in your home while you're away. You'd want them to have:

1. **A badge** that proves who they are
2. **A list of what rooms they can enter** — and which ones are off-limits
3. **A work log** you can review when you get home

That's exactly what Supravisor does for your AI agent.

- **Issuer** = the company that issued the contractor's badge (that's you)
- **Passport** = the badge itself
- **Gate** = the door that checks the badge before letting anyone through
- **Guardrails** = the list of what's allowed and what isn't
- **Attestation** = the tamper-proof work log

  <Card title="Gate — The Checkpoint" icon="shield-check">
    A gate sits in front of whatever your agent wants to access. Every time the agent tries to do something, the gate checks its passport, reads the rules, and makes a decision — allow or deny — in under a millisecond.

  <Card title="Guardrails — The Rules" icon="book-open">
    You decide the rules: how much money it can spend per day, which websites it can visit, how many actions it can take per hour, whether it needs your approval before doing something big.

## Getting Started: 8 Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Account">
    Go to [uniplex.ai](https://uniplex.ai) and sign up. Use your work email if this is for a business agent.

    Once you're in, you'll land on the dashboard — your control center for everything.

    **What this gets you:** A place to create and manage all your agent credentials and rules.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Issuer">
    In the left sidebar, click **Issuers** → **New Issuer**. Give it a name (e.g., "My Personal Agents" or "Acme Corp"). Click **Generate Keys**.

    Supravisor will create a cryptographic stamp right in your browser — nothing is sent to the server.

    <Warning>
      The private key is generated in your browser and shown exactly once. Copy it immediately and store it in a password manager. Supravisor never sees it and cannot help you recover it.
    </Warning>

    **What this gets you:** Your official stamp. Every passport you create will say "issued by you," making it verifiable by anyone who checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Issue a Passport for Your Agent">
    Click **Passports** → **Issue Passport**. Fill in:

    - **Agent Name:** Something descriptive like "Research Bot" or "My Email Helper"
    - **Agent ID:** A short label like `research-bot` (no spaces)
    - **Permissions:** What this agent is allowed to do — start conservative (e.g., `web:search` only)
    - **Expiration:** 90 days is a sensible starting point

    Click **Issue Passport**.

    **What this gets you:** Your agent now has an official identity document — a signed record of who it is and what it's authorized to do.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Private Key">
    After creating the passport, you'll see the **private key** — a long string of random characters. This is shown **exactly once**.

    Copy it and store it safely (a password manager is ideal). This is how your agent proves its identity. Treat it like a password — anyone who has it can act as that agent.

    <Note>
      Using Claude Code? Add `UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY=your_key_here` to your `.env` file in the project root. The SDK picks it up automatically.
    </Note>

    **What this gets you:** The secret your agent needs to prove it's really who it claims to be.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Gate">
    Click **Gates** → **New Gate**. Give it a name like "Research Gate" or "Email Gate."

    Under **Trusted Issuers**, select the issuer you just created. Under **Security Level**, start with **L2 (Standard)** for anything that will touch the internet.

    **What this gets you:** The checkpoint. Your gate will now check passports against your issuer's stamp and reject anything that doesn't match.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply a Template">
    Still on the gate creation screen, click **Choose Template**. Browse the 30 built-in profiles:

    - 🔍 **Web Research Agent** — search and read, nothing else
    - 📧 **Personal Email Agent** — read and send, capped at 50/day
    - 💻 **Code Review Agent** — read code and add comments, can't push to main
    - 💰 **Budget Tracker** — read financial data, never execute transactions

    Pick the one closest to your use case. You can adjust individual rules after.

    **What this gets you:** A pre-built rulebook. Instead of configuring 26 settings from scratch, you pick a profile and you're done in 30 seconds.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test It">
    On your gate's page, click the **Test** tab. Paste your passport token and type an action like `web:search`. Click **Check**.

    You'll see either ✅ **Allowed** or ❌ **Denied**, along with the exact reason. This is the same check your agent will face in real use.

    **What this gets you:** Confidence that everything is working before you connect a real AI agent. No surprises.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Your Audit Trail">
    After your agent has done some work, click **Activity** in the sidebar. Every action your agent attempted is listed here, with:

    - What it tried to do
    - Whether it was allowed or denied
    - Exactly which rule triggered (if denied)
    - A cryptographic signature proving the record hasn't been altered

    **What this gets you:** A permanent, tamper-proof record of everything your agent did. If something goes wrong, you'll know exactly what happened.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I lose the private key?">
    If you lose a passport's private key, you'll need to issue a new one. The old passport should be **revoked immediately** — go to **Passports** → find it → **Revoke**. This cancels it so no one else can use it.

    There's no "reset" — the key is generated in your browser and Supravisor never sees it. This is why storing it in a password manager the moment you see it matters so much.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can my agent do things I haven't allowed?">
    Not if it's connected to a gate. The gate checks every action before it executes. If the action isn't in the passport's permissions, or if a guardrail is violated (like a spending limit), the gate returns a denial and the agent can't proceed.

    If your agent is running without a Supravisor connection, there's no enforcement. The MCP integration is the easiest way to make sure enforcement is always on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this only for Claude?">
    Not at all. Supravisor works with any AI agent — Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, custom Python scripts, LangChain agents, AutoGen workflows. Anything that can carry a token or make an API call can be protected.

    Claude has the deepest integration because it speaks MCP natively, but the Python and TypeScript SDKs work everywhere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a Passport and a Gate?">
    Think of it this way:

    - A **Passport** is carried by the agent — it's the agent's ID card that travels with every request
    - A **Gate** is installed by you — it's the checkpoint that reads the passport and decides what's allowed

    One agent has one passport. You can have many gates for different resources. The same agent can be checked by different gates with different rules.

    And here's the thing most people don't realize: **you don't need a gate to get enforcement**. Issue a passport and you get policy enforcement immediately. The gate adds remote verification and a managed audit trail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to be a developer?">
    For the dashboard — no. Creating issuers, issuing passports, setting up gates, applying templates, and reading the audit trail all happen point-and-click.

    For connecting Supravisor to an AI agent, the easiest no-code path is the MCP integration. Run one command (`npx uniplex-mcp-manage`), add Supravisor as an MCP server in Claude's settings, and you're done.

    If you want to protect a custom script or application, you'll need a few lines of Python or TypeScript. The SDK is designed to be approachable even for non-engineers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if it's working?">
    Three ways to check:

    1. **Test tab on your gate** — paste the passport token and test an action. Instant feedback.
    2. **Activity page** — after your agent runs, every action appears here within seconds. Green checkmarks = working.
    3. **Try a blocked action** — add `files:delete` to your blocklist, then have your agent try to delete a file. If it gets a denial with a clear reason, Supravisor is enforcing correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my agent tries something it's not allowed to do?">
    The gate blocks it and returns a denial. Your agent gets a clear error message explaining exactly what rule was violated. That denial is also recorded as an attestation — so you can see in the audit trail that it happened, when it happened, and which rule triggered.

    Nothing executes. The agent can't proceed. You're in control.
  </Accordion>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to be a developer to use this?">
    No. The dashboard handles everything — creating issuers, issuing passports, setting up gates, applying templates, and reading the audit trail all happen point-and-click. No code required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my agent tries to do something I haven't allowed?">
    It gets blocked. The gate returns a denial and the agent can't proceed. You get a log entry showing exactly what was attempted, when it happened, and which rule triggered. The agent is told why it was denied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I turn this off if I want my agent to have full access?">
    Yes. L1 passports accept self-issued credentials and can be configured to allow anything. You can grant your agent the `*` permission (full access) at any time — you're always in control of what the rules are.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my agent's data private?">
    Yes. The gate runs locally. Your agent's actions never pass through Supravisor's servers unless you explicitly use the hosted verification endpoint. What your agent does stays on your infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I lose the private key?">
    Issue a new passport. Revoke the old one in one click — go to **Passports** → find it → **Revoke**. The old passport is immediately cancelled and can't be used again.
  </Accordion>
