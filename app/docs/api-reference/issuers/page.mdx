# Issuers API

Issuers are the trust anchors. Every passport must be signed by an issuer, and gates verify passports by checking whether the signing issuer is in their trusted list.

When you create an issuer, you become the authority that signs credentials for your agents. You control which agents exist and what they're permitted to claim.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl https://uniplex.ai/api/issuers \

      "name": "Production Agents",
      "description": "Signs all production agent credentials",
      "trust_tier": "internal",
      "public_key": "base64_ed25519_public_key...",

## Create Issuer

Create a new issuer. Provide your own `public_key` if you generated the keypair yourself (recommended for production — key generation in browser never sends the private key to Supravisor). Omit `public_key` to have Supravisor generate a keypair server-side.

```
POST /api/issuers
```

**Required scope:** `issuers:create`

**Request Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | ✅ | Human-readable name |
| `issuer_id` | string | ✅ | Unique identifier in `issuer:domain` format |
| `description` | string | ❌ | Optional notes |
| `public_key` | string | ❌ | Base64 Ed25519 public key if you generated the keypair yourself |

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://uniplex.ai/api/issuers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer uni_xxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Production Agents",
    "issuer_id": "issuer:acmecorp.ai",
    "description": "Signs all production agent credentials"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "issuer_id": "issuer:acmecorp.ai",
  "name": "Production Agents",
  "trust_tier": "internal",
  "public_key": "base64_ed25519_public_key...",
  "private_key": "base64_ed25519_private_key_SHOWN_ONCE",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2026-02-24T10:00:00Z"
}
```

<Warning>
  `private_key` is shown exactly once. Store it in `UNIPLEX_ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY` in your secrets manager immediately. It cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Update Issuer

Update an issuer's name or description. The keypair and issuer ID cannot be changed.

```
PUT /api/issuers/:issuer_id
```

**Required scope:** `issuers:update`

```bash
curl -X PUT https://uniplex.ai/api/issuers/issuer:acmecorp.ai \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer uni_xxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Production Agents v2",
    "description": "Updated for Q2 2026 deployment"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "issuer_id": "issuer:acmecorp.ai",
  "name": "Production Agents v2",
  "description": "Updated for Q2 2026 deployment",
  "status": "active",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-24T10:30:00Z"
}

---

## Revoke Issuer

Revoke an issuer. Every passport signed by this issuer becomes invalid immediately — all agents using those passports lose access.

```
DELETE /api/issuers/:issuer_id
```

**Required scope:** `issuers:update`

<Warning>
  Issuer revocation is **immediate and irreversible**. Migrate all agents to a new issuer before revoking. The response shows how many passports are invalidated.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://uniplex.ai/api/issuers/issuer:acmecorp.ai \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer uni_xxxx"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "issuer_id": "issuer:acmecorp.ai",
  "status": "revoked",
  "revoked_at": "2026-02-24T11:00:00Z",
  "passports_invalidated": 12
}
```
