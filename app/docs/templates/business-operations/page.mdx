# Business Operations Templates

Six templates for business process automation. These are built for team deployments where more than one person is affected by what the agent does.

The defaults are conservative for a reason: customer data, financial records, and employee information have legal implications. The templates reflect what goes wrong in practice — support bots that can accidentally close tickets, sales agents that can email without approval, HR agents that shouldn't see salary data.

## 1. Customer Support Agent

**What it does:** Reads your knowledge base, responds to support tickets, and escalates to a human when needed — without touching payments, closing tickets autonomously, or accessing PII in bulk.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `action_allowlist` | `tickets:read, tickets:respond, kb:read, tickets:tag` | No delete, close, or payment access |
| `action_blocklist` | `tickets:delete, tickets:close, payments:*` | Hard blocks |
| `required` | `ticket_id` | Every action tagged to a ticket |
| `no_pii_export` | `true` | Customer data protection |

```json
{
  "template": "customer-support-agent",
  "constraints": {
    "action_allowlist": [
      "tickets:read",
      "tickets:respond",
      "tickets:tag",
      "tickets:escalate",
      "kb:read",
      "kb:search"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "tickets:delete",
      "tickets:close",
      "tickets:bulk_update",
      "payments:read",
      "payments:send"
    ],
    "required": "ticket_id",
    "no_pii_export": true,
    "max_per_minute": 10,
    "read_only": false
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Configure your ticket system to pause agent responses when terms like "refund," "lawyer," or "cancel account" appear — before Supravisor evaluation even runs.
</Tip>

## 2. Sales Development Agent

**What it does:** Researches prospects and prepares outreach — but cannot send a single email without a human approving it first. Research is fully automated. Sending requires a human in the loop.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `action_allowlist` | `web:search, crm:read, crm:update, email:draft` | Draft only, not send |
| `action_blocklist` | `email:send, email:schedule` | No autonomous sending |
| `no_pii_export` | `true` | No bulk prospect export |

```json
{
  "template": "sales-development-agent",
  "constraints": {
    "action_allowlist": [
      "web:search",
      "web:read",
      "crm:read",
      "crm:create",
      "crm:update",
      "email:draft",
      "email:read"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "email:send",
      "email:schedule",
      "email:bulk_send",
      "crm:delete"
    ],
    "no_pii_export": true,
    "max_per_hour": 50,
    "domain_allowlist": "linkedin.com,crunchbase.com,apollo.io",
    "required": "prospect_id"
  }
}
```

## 3. Contract Review Agent

**What it does:** Reads contracts, flags clause types (liability caps, auto-renewal, IP assignment), and produces summaries — without modifying any documents. Ever.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `read_only` | `true` | Absolute — no modifications |
| `action_allowlist` | `files:read, docs:read, docs:summarize` | Read and local annotation only |
| `no_pii_export` | `true` | No customer PII in outputs |
| `domain_blocklist` | External AI services | No contract text to third-party AI |

```json
{
  "template": "contract-review-agent",
  "constraints": {
    "read_only": true,
    "action_allowlist": [
      "files:read",
      "docs:read",
      "docs:search",
      "docs:summarize"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "docs:write",
      "docs:sign",
      "docs:share_external",
      "files:upload_external"
    ],
    "domain_blocklist": "openai.com,anthropic.com,chatgpt.com",
    "no_pii_export": true,
    "required": "document_id"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  The `domain_blocklist` for external AI services ensures that contract text is not sent to third-party AI services. If you need AI summarization, add your specific API domain to the allowlist and audit the integration.
</Warning>

## 4. HR Onboarding Agent

**What it does:** Sends templated onboarding emails, provisions accounts, and guides new hires — without access to salary data, SSNs, or bank information.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `action_allowlist` | `email:send_template, hris:read_public, accounts:provision` | Templates only, no freeform |
| `action_blocklist` | `hris:read_salary, hris:read_ssn, hris:delete` | Hard blocks on sensitive fields |
| `no_pii_export` | `true` | No bulk employee data export |
| `required` | `employee_id` | Every action tagged to an employee |

```json
{
  "template": "hr-onboarding-agent",
  "constraints": {
    "action_allowlist": [
      "email:send_template",
      "hris:read_public",
      "hris:update_onboarding_status",
      "accounts:provision",
      "calendar:create_onboarding_events",
      "docs:send_template"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "hris:read_salary",
      "hris:read_ssn",
      "hris:read_bank_info",
      "hris:delete",
      "email:send_freeform"
    ],
    "no_pii_export": true,
    "required": "employee_id",
    "read_only": false
  }
}
```

## 5. Expense Report Agent

**What it does:** Reads receipts and expense submissions, creates records in your expense system, and prepares reports — without the ability to approve, execute, or reject payments.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `action_allowlist` | `expenses:read, expenses:create, receipts:read` | Create records, not payments |
| `action_blocklist` | `payments:*, expenses:approve, expenses:reject` | No payment execution |
| `approval_threshold` | `$500.00` | Human reviews large expense reports |
| `no_pii_export` | `true` | Receipts may contain PII |

```json
{
  "template": "expense-report-agent",
  "constraints": {
    "action_allowlist": [
      "expenses:read",
      "expenses:create",
      "expenses:update_draft",
      "receipts:read",
      "receipts:ocr",
      "reports:create"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "payments:send",
      "payments:approve",
      "expenses:approve",
      "expenses:reject",
      "expenses:delete"
    ],
    "approval_threshold": "$500.00",
    "no_pii_export": true,
    "required": "submitter_id"
  }
}
```

## 6. Meeting Scheduler

**What it does:** Reads calendars, proposes times, creates events, and sends invitations — with limits on external invitations to prevent calendar spam or data leakage.

| Constraint | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| `action_allowlist` | `calendar:read, calendar:create, calendar:invite` | R/W with invite cap |
| `action_blocklist` | `calendar:delete_all, calendar:export_all` | No bulk operations |
| `max_per_hour` | `20 external invites` | Prevent calendar bombing |
| `domain_allowlist` | Company domains | External invites to approved domains only |

```json
{
  "template": "meeting-scheduler",
  "constraints": {
    "action_allowlist": [
      "calendar:read",
      "calendar:create",
      "calendar:update",
      "calendar:invite_internal",
      "calendar:invite_external",
      "calendar:find_free_time"
    ],
    "action_blocklist": [
      "calendar:delete",
      "calendar:cancel_all",
      "calendar:export_all"
    ],
    "max_per_hour": 20,
    "domain_allowlist": "mycompany.com,partnercompany.com",
    "required": "organizer_id"
  }
}
```
