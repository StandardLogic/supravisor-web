# Constraint Templates

Building guardrails from scratch means configuring 26 constraint types and hoping you didn't miss anything important.

Templates skip that. Thirty pre-built constraint profiles, organized by agent type, built around real-world usage patterns. Pick the one closest to your use case and you're 90% done. Adjust the remaining 10% if needed.

These aren't suggestions — they're configurations that have been tested against common edge cases. The Customer Support Agent blocks payment access because support bots getting near payment systems is a well-documented failure mode. The Web Research Agent uses an allowlist instead of a blocklist because allowlisting is strictly safer. The Financial Agent requires L3 trust because the stakes justify the overhead.

Start with a template. Customize if you need to. Skip the blank-page problem.

|----------|-------|---------|------|----------------|
| Web Research Agent | L2 | $20/day | 200/hr | Domain allowlist, read-only |
| Customer Support Agent | L2 | None | 10/min | No payments, PII block |
| Code Review Agent | L2 | None | 30/hr | No git push/merge |
| Budget Tracker | L2 | Read-only | — | No transactions |
| Financial Agent | L3 | $500/day + approval | — | PII block, audit required |
| Personal Email Agent | L1/L2 | 50 sends/day | 20/hr | No bulk export |

## Customizing After Applying

Templates are starting points, not requirements. After applying, you can:

- **Adjust spending limits** — increase if you have a bigger budget, decrease for tighter control
- **Modify domain lists** — add your internal APIs, remove services you don't use
- **Change the rate limits** — based on actual usage patterns from your audit trail
- **Switch the security level** — upgrade to L3 for higher-stakes deployments

Every customization is tracked in the gate's configuration history.

## Building Your Own Template

If you've dialed in a constraint configuration that works, save it as a custom template:

```bash
curl -X POST https://uniplex.ai/api/templates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer uni_xxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Company Research Agent",
    "category": "research",
    "constraints": {
      "read_only": true,
      "domain_allowlist": "google.com,arxiv.org,internal.mycompany.com",
      "max_per_day": "$30.00",
      "no_pii_export": true
    }
  }'
```

Custom templates appear in the dashboard alongside the built-in ones.
