AI agents with no guardrails are a liability. Let's fix that — fast.

Five minutes. Python or TypeScript. A verified agent with real policy enforcement at the end.

---

## Before You Start

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 18+
- A [Supravisor account](https://uniplex.ai/signup) (free tier works)

---

## Step 1: Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install uniplex
```
```bash TypeScript
npm install uniplex
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 2: Create an Issuer

Your Issuer is your signing authority — the organization stamp that vouches for every agent you create. Think of it as your own private DMV.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://uniplex.ai/dashboard)
2. Click **Issuers** in the left sidebar → **Create Issuer**
3. Enter a name (e.g. "My Agents") and a domain (e.g. `mycompany.ai`)
4. Click **Create** — your Ed25519 (a type of digital signature that's mathematically impossible to forge) keypair is generated in your browser

<Note>
Your issuer's private key is generated in your browser and **never sent to Supravisor**. Keep it safe — it's the root of trust for all your agents.
</Note>

---

## Step 3: Issue a Passport

A passport is your agent's ID card — a tamper-proof record of who it is and what it's allowed to do.

1. Click **Passports** → **Issue Passport**
2. Select your issuer
3. Set an Agent ID (e.g. `research-agent-001`) and name
4. Choose permissions (e.g. `mcp:*` for MCP tools, `web:search` to scope it tighter)
5. Set an expiry — 90 days is a good starting point
6. Click **Issue Passport**

<Warning>
**Save the private key right now.** It appears exactly once and cannot be recovered. Copy it to a password manager or `.env` file before you do anything else.
</Warning>

---

## Step 4: Set Your Environment Variable

```bash
export UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY="your-private-key-here"
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```bash .env
UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

---

## Step 5: Initialize Your Agent

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from uniplex import Agent

# Reads UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY from your environment automatically
agent = Agent.from_env()

# Or load explicitly if you prefer
agent = Agent(
    passport_id="uni_xxxxxxxx",
    private_key=os.environ["UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY"],
)

print(f"Agent ready: {agent.agent_id}")
print(f"Permissions: {agent.permissions}")
print(f"Expires: {agent.expires_at.date()}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Agent } from 'uniplex';

// Reads UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY from your environment automatically
const agent = await Agent.fromEnv();

// Or load explicitly
const agent = new Agent({
  passportId: "uni_xxxxxxxx",
  privateKey: process.env.UNIPLEX_PASSPORT_KEY!,
});

console.log(`Agent ready: ${agent.agentId}`);
console.log(`Permissions: ${agent.permissions.join(', ')}`);
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 6: Authorize an Action

This is the moment enforcement happens. Every action your agent wants to take runs through this check first.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Check if your agent can do something
decision = agent.authorize("mcp:search")

if decision.allowed:
    print(f"✓ Authorized — attestation: {decision.attestation_id}")
    # Your agent proceeds with the action
else:
    print(f"✗ Denied: {decision.reason}")
    # Blocked. The reason tells you exactly why.
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Check if your agent can do something
const decision = await agent.authorize("mcp:search");

if (decision.allowed) {
  console.log(`✓ Authorized — attestation: ${decision.attestationId}`);
  // Your agent proceeds with the action
} else {
  console.log(`✗ Denied: ${decision.reason}`);
  // Blocked. The reason tells you exactly why.
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Every `authorize()` call produces an attestation — a signed, tamper-proof record of the decision. That's your audit trail, built automatically.

<Note>
  **What just happened?** Your agent tried an action. The SDK checked the passport's permission list, verified the signature, and evaluated any constraints — all in-process, with no network call. The answer came back in microseconds. That's it. That's enforcement.
</Note>

## Step 7: Add a Gate (Upgrades Everything)

The steps above give you passport-level enforcement immediately. A Gate adds remote verification, per-gate guardrails, and a full audit trail in the dashboard.

1. Click **Gates** → **Create Gate**
2. Choose a security level (L1 for dev, L2 for production)
3. Select which issuers to trust
4. Apply a template or set custom guardrails
5. Use the gate ID in your code:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uniplex import Gate, TrustProfile

gate = Gate(
    gate_id="gate_xxxxxxxx",    # From the dashboard
    profile=TrustProfile.L2,
    trusted_issuers=["issuer:mycompany.ai"],
    constraints={
        "max_per_day": "$50.00",        # Spending cap
        "max_per_minute": 10,           # Rate limit
        "domain_allowlist": "openai.com,anthropic.com"  # Allowed domains
    }
)

# Now checks against the gate's full ruleset
decision = gate.authorize(agent.generate_token(), "mcp:search")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Gate, TrustProfile } from 'uniplex';

const gate = new Gate({
  gateId: "gate_xxxxxxxx",    // From the dashboard
  profile: TrustProfile.L2,
  trustedIssuers: ["issuer:mycompany.ai"],
  constraints: {
    maxPerDay: "$50.00",        // Spending cap
    maxPerMinute: 10,           // Rate limit
    domainAllowlist: "openai.com,anthropic.com"  // Allowed domains
  }
});

const decision = await gate.authorize(agent.generateToken(), "mcp:search");
```
</CodeGroup>

## What You Just Built

You have:
- ✅ An AI agent with a verified, cryptographic identity
- ✅ Policy enforcement on every action it takes
- ✅ A signed audit trail that can't be altered
- ✅ One-click revocation if anything goes wrong

## Where You Are — And Where You Can Go

You're currently at **Level 1** of progressive adoption. Each level adds more:

| Level | What You Use | Infrastructure | Time to Value |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **1 — Passport Only** | Passport + SDK enforcement | **None** | 5 minutes |
| **2 — Gate Only** | Gate + anonymous access | Gate server | 15 minutes |
| **3 — Passport + Gate** | Full verification + audit trail | Gate server | 30 minutes |
| **4 — Full Stack** | Issuers, Passports, Gates, Catalogs, Commerce, Attestations | Full platform | Hours |

Step 7 above moves you to Level 3. You don't have to do it today.
